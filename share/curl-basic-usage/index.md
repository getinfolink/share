To use curl with an authorization token in the request header, you can use the -H option. Here’s the general syntax:

bash
Copy code
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" https://api.example.com/endpoint
Example Usage
Assuming you have an API endpoint at https://api.example.com/data and a token abc123, here’s how you would make a GET request with the token in the header:

bash
Copy code
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer abc123" https://api.example.com/data
Additional curl Options
You can also add other options to your curl request, such as -X for HTTP method or -d for request body data.

Example: POST request with JSON data and Authorization token
bash
Copy code
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/data \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer abc123" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"key": "value"}'
In this example:

-X POST specifies the HTTP method.
-H "Content-Type: application/json" sets the request to use JSON format.
-d sends JSON data in the request body.
Replace YOUR_TOKEN and https://api.example.com/endpoint with your actual token and API endpoint.
